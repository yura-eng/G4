## Overview
This lesson plan is designed for middle school students and focuses on enhancing listening and writing skills through interactive activities using Gradio and Python coding. The lesson is based on the story "The Fox and the Grapes."

## Objectives
- 📚 Improve vocabulary knowledge
- 🎧 Enhance listening comprehension
- 🧩 Develop sequencing skills
- ✍️ Foster creative writing abilities

## Tools Used

**Gradio:** For creating interactive web apps.

**Python:** Programming language for implementing Gradio apps.

**Canva:** An online design tool for creating graphics, presentations, and more using templates and easy editing features.

## Teaching Procedure (55 minutes in total)

### 1. 🎧 Listening Activity (35 minutes)

#### (1) Pre-Listening Activity: Learning New Words (10 minutes)

**🎯Objective:** Introduce and discuss new vocabulary from the story.

**✏️Activity:** Use the Gradio Wordcloud App to create a word cloud highlighting frequent words from the text.

**👨‍🏫Teacher's Role:** Display the word cloud on a projector and discuss the highlighted words with students. Explain meanings, provide examples, and answer any questions.

**👦👧Students' Role:** Participate in the discussion, take notes on new vocabulary, and ask questions about any unfamiliar words.

#### (2) While-Listening Activity (15 minutes)

**🎯Objective:** Enhance listening comprehension and focus on past tense verbs.

**✏️Activity:**
- Use the Gradio TTS App to convert the text to an audio file. Play the audio for students.
- Provide a cloze exercise using the Gradio Cloze Question App, focusing on past tense verbs. Students fill in the blanks while listening.

**👨‍🏫Teacher's Role:**
- Play the audio file and monitor students' progress.
- Distribute the cloze exercise and guide students through it.

**👦👧Students' Role:**
- Listen to the audio and complete the cloze exercise by filling in the blanks with past tense verbs.
- Check the answers and learn the base forms of the verbs.

#### (3) After-Listening Activity: Sequence the Story (10 minutes)

**🎯Objective:** Develop sequencing skills by arranging images in the correct order.

**✏️Activity:** Use the Gradio Image Sequencing App to provide images related to the story. Students arrange the images in the correct sequence based on what they heard.

**👨‍🏫Teacher's Role:**
- Display the images using the Image Sequencing App.
- Guide students through the activity, asking them to justify their choices.

**👦👧Students' Role:**
- Work individually or in pairs to arrange the images in the correct sequence.
- Discuss and explain their reasoning for the order they chose.

### 2. ✍️ Writing Activity (20 minutes)

**🎯Objective:** Foster creative writing and check for grammatical accuracy.

**✏️Activity:**
- Provide the following writing prompt: "In the story, the Fox tries repeatedly to reach a tempting bunch of grapes, only to give up and convince himself that the grapes were not worth the effort. Have you ever had an experience where you worked hard to achieve something but decided to give up in the end? Share your story. Describe what you were trying to accomplish, why you stopped, and how you felt afterward. Reflect on your decision and relate it to the lesson in the story. Remember to use past tense in your writing and provide reasons for your feelings and actions."
- Use the Gradio Writing Checker App to allow students to check their writing for errors.

**👨‍🏫Teacher's Role:**
- Introduce the writing prompt and explain the task.
- Assist students in using the Writing Checker App to review and correct their writing.

**👦👧Students' Role:**
- Write a response to the prompt.
- Use the Writing Checker App to check their writing and make corrections based on the feedback.

### Notes for Teachers

- ✅ Ensure all Gradio apps are set up and tested before the lesson.
- 🛠️ Be prepared to assist students with any technical issues that may arise while using the apps.
- 💬 Encourage students to actively participate and ask questions throughout the lesson.
- ⚙️ Adapt the activities as needed based on the students' proficiency levels and engagement.

### 3. 🎬 WordCloud - 동화제목 맞추기 (10 minutes)

**🎯Objective:**
- Enhance vocabulary recognition and prediction skills by interpreting a word cloud to guess the title of a story.

**✏️Activity:**
- Display a word cloud generated from the story text ("The Fox and the Grapes") using the Gradio Wordcloud App.
- Students observe the word cloud and identify frequently used words.
- Students submit their guesses for the story title through the app.
- Discuss the correct title and its connection to the highlighted words in the word cloud.

**👨‍🏫Teacher's Role:**
- Explain how word clouds work and their purpose in highlighting key words.
- Facilitate discussion by encouraging students to think critically about the words in the cloud.
- Provide hints if needed and reveal the correct title through the app.

**👦👧Students' Role:**
- Analyze the word cloud and identify key words.
- Discuss potential story titles in pairs or small groups before submitting their guesses.
- Reflect on their guesses and participate in the discussion about the correct title and the story's main themes.

## Lesson Materials

### Story Title: 🍇The Fox and the Grape🍇
+ [picture book link](https://read.gov/aesop/005.html)

**<Synopsis>**
A hungry Fox spots a luscious bunch of ripe grapes hanging high on a vine and eagerly attempts to reach them. Despite his best efforts—jumping repeatedly and even taking a running leap—he fails to grab the grapes. Exhausted and annoyed, the Fox walks away, consoling himself by declaring the grapes sour and not worth the effort. His reaction reflects the human tendency to downplay the value of unattainable goals as a way to cope with disappointment. This classic fable serves as a reminder to acknowledge our limitations while striving for self-awareness and humility.
